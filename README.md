Rules of the Game

Four kinds items appear on the game board.

J*Man. J*Man is vaguely asterisk shaped and will be red, yellow, or green. His color determines what other pieces he can capture. There is only one J*Man.
White blocks. They just sit there, getting in the way.
Walkers. They are circular. They are red, yellow, or green. As J*Man moves about the board, the walkers wander about slowly.
Pillars, which appear as red, yellow, or green triangles. Pillars don't move. They change color randomly.
The goal is to use the four navigation buttons to move J*Man about the board until he has captured all the walkers and pillars. J*Man cannot capture a walker or a pillar unless their colors are appropriate. J*Man can capture:

a red piece only if he, himself, is green;
a yellow piece only if he is red; and
a green piece only if he is yellow.
Whenever J*Man captures a piece, he takes on that piece's color.

J*Man and the walkers follow the following rule: If they try to move into a square that is occupied by something they cannot capture (for a walker, any occupied space) or try to move off the map, they don't move.
